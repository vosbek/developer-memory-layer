# Backend Services Architecture

## Overview
The Developer Memory Layer backend is designed to scale from individual developers to enterprise teams, with proper authentication, data isolation, and real-time collaboration.

## Services Architecture

### Core Services
- **API Gateway** - Authentication, rate limiting, routing
- **Memory Service** - CRUD operations for memories
- **Graph Service** - Knowledge graph generation and analysis
- **Search Service** - Vector embeddings and semantic search
- **Integration Service** - External tool integrations (GitHub, Jira, etc.)
- **Real-time Service** - WebSocket connections for live updates
- **Notification Service** - Alerts and updates

### Data Layer
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary data store (memories, users, teams)
- **Redis** - Caching and session management
- **Vector Database** - Embeddings storage (Pinecone/Weaviate)
- **ElasticSearch** - Full-text search and analytics

### Infrastructure
- **Docker** - Containerization
- **Kubernetes** - Orchestration (for enterprise)
- **AWS/Azure** - Cloud deployment
- **Terraform** - Infrastructure as code

## Scaling Strategy

### Individual Developer (1 user)
- Single Docker Compose stack
- Local PostgreSQL + Redis
- No authentication required
- Local vector storage

### Small Team (2-5 users)
- Multi-container setup
- Shared database with user isolation
- Basic authentication (JWT)
- Team collaboration features

### Company Wide (50+ users)
- Kubernetes deployment
- Managed databases
- Enterprise SSO integration
- Advanced analytics and insights
- Multi-tenant architecture

## Data Model

### User/Team Isolation
```sql
-- Users belong to teams/organizations
-- Memories are scoped to teams
-- Privacy levels: private, team, public
```

### Collaboration Features
- Shared memories within teams
- Memory recommendations across team members
- Knowledge gap analysis
- Expertise mapping

## Security & Privacy
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive memories
- GDPR compliance
- SOC 2 Type II ready
- Enterprise SSO integration
- Audit logging
