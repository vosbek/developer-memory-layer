# 📧📊 Email, SharePoint & Excel Integration Guide

## How It Captures Your Work Automatically

### **📧 Email Integration**

#### **What Gets Captured**
- **Decision emails**: "We've decided to use React for the frontend"
- **Technical discussions**: Architecture debates, API design conversations
- **Problem-solving threads**: Bug reports, solutions, post-mortems
- **Project updates**: Sprint reviews, release planning, status updates

#### **Smart Filtering**
The system automatically identifies relevant emails using:
```javascript
// Looks for technical keywords
Keywords: ['architecture', 'deployment', 'bug', 'fix', 'API', 'database', 
          'performance', 'security', 'github', 'jira', 'pull request']

// Decision language
Decision patterns: ['decided', 'approved', 'rejected', 'agreed', 'chosen']

// Project language  
Project terms: ['sprint', 'release', 'milestone', 'requirements', 'specification']
```

#### **Real-World Examples**

**📧 Email Thread Captured:**
```
Subject: "API Rate Limiting Decision"
From: architect@company.com
Content: "After reviewing the options, we've decided to implement 
rate limiting using Redis with a sliding window approach. 
This will give us better performance than the token bucket method..."

→ Becomes Memory:
Title: "Email: API Rate Limiting Decision"
Type: Meeting/Decision
Tags: [API, redis, rate-limiting, architecture]
Links: [Direct link to email in Outlook]
```

### **📊 SharePoint Integration**

#### **Document Discovery**
Automatically scans your SharePoint sites for:

**📁 Technical Documentation**
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- System design documents
- API specifications
- Deployment runbooks
- Technical requirements
- Project documentation

**📋 Structured Data**
- Decision logs (SharePoint lists)
- Project trackers
- Issue registers
- Knowledge base articles

#### **Content Extraction**

**Word Documents (.docx)**
```javascript
// Extracts full text content
"System Architecture Overview
Our microservices architecture consists of..."

→ Memory: "System Architecture Overview"
→ Tags: [microservices, architecture, system-design]
```

**Excel Spreadsheets (.xlsx)**
```javascript
// Extracts structured data
Sheet: "API Endpoints"
| Endpoint | Method | Description | Owner |
| /users   | GET    | Get users   | John  |
| /orders  | POST   | Create order| Sarah |

→ Memory: "API Endpoints Documentation" 
→ Content: "API endpoints table with GET /users, POST /orders..."
→ Tags: [API, endpoints, documentation]
```

**SharePoint Lists**
```javascript
// Decision Log List
Title: "Database Migration Decision"
Status: "Approved" 
Decision: "Migrate to PostgreSQL for better performance"
Date: "2025-06-09"

→ Memory: "Database Migration Decision"
→ Type: Meeting/Decision
→ Tags: [database, postgresql, migration]
```

### **🔄 Automated Workflow**

#### **Daily Sync Process**
```bash
# Every morning at 9 AM
1. Scan last 24 hours of emails
2. Check SharePoint for new/updated documents  
3. Process Excel files and extract insights
4. Create memories automatically
5. Send summary to your dashboard
```

#### **What You See**
```
🌅 Good morning! Here's what I captured yesterday:

📧 3 new email memories:
   ├─ "Sprint Planning Decision" (Teams meeting follow-up)
   ├─ "Database Performance Issue" (Bug report thread)  
   └─ "API Security Review" (Architecture discussion)

📊 2 SharePoint documents:
   ├─ "Q3 Roadmap.docx" (Updated project timeline)
   └─ "Service Dependencies.xlsx" (New system mapping)

🔗 All connected to your existing knowledge graph
```

### **💡 Real-World Use Cases**

#### **Use Case 1: Architecture Decision Recovery**
```
🔍 You search "database" in your memory layer

Results show:
├─ 📧 Email: "Database Migration Decision" (last month)
├─ 📊 Excel: "Database Performance Metrics" (SharePoint)
├─ 📄 Word: "Database Architecture ADR" (SharePoint)
└─ 💬 Teams: "Database discussion notes" (meeting)

💡 Complete context of every database decision your team made
```

#### **Use Case 2: Onboarding New Developer**
```
🆕 New teammate asks: "How do we handle authentication?"

Your memory layer shows:
├─ 📧 Email thread about Auth0 integration decision
├─ 📊 Excel sheet with API endpoint security specs  
├─ 📄 Word doc with authentication flow diagram
└─ 🔗 GitHub links to actual implementation

⚡ 5 minutes vs 5 hours of explanation
```

#### **Use Case 3: Incident Response**
```
🚨 Production issue at 3 AM

You search "similar error message" and find:
├─ 📧 Email from last incident with exact solution
├─ 📊 Excel runbook with step-by-step fix process
├─ 📄 Post-mortem document with root cause analysis
└─ 🔗 Links to monitoring dashboards

🎯 Problem solved using your team's own experience
```

### **🎯 Smart Content Analysis**

#### **AI-Powered Relevance Scoring**
```javascript
Email Analysis:
├─ "We decided to use React" → Relevance: 95% (Decision + Technical)
├─ "Happy birthday John!" → Relevance: 5% (Personal)  
├─ "API performance is slow" → Relevance: 85% (Technical Problem)
└─ "Meeting moved to 3pm" → Relevance: 15% (Administrative)

Only captures high-relevance content (>70%)
```

#### **Automatic Tagging**
```javascript
Content: "After testing both Redis and Memcached for our caching layer, 
we've decided to go with Redis due to its persistence capabilities..."

Auto-extracted tags:
├─ Technical: [redis, memcached, caching, persistence]
├─ Decision: [decided, chosen, selected]  
├─ Context: [performance, testing, comparison]
```
